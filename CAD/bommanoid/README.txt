korgmicrokey37.FCStd = nothing really
sketch1.FCStd = nothing really
ideal.FCStd = some bell placement ideas (obsolete mostly)
speakercab1.FCStd = proposed prod design of cab, with actual dimensions
bommanoid00 = sketches of keyboard case design; not for prod
bommanoid01 = fork of clarinoid test device 05; bringing in all bommanoid components.
              schematic, pcb sketches, and footprints added. not everything 100% double-checked.
              beginning to build pcbs out and do final checks, lets fork before i
              ruin my sketches.
bommanoid02 = continuing design & first attempts at routing
bommanoid03 = continuing routing; it's basically done before panelization & jlcpcb BOM
bommanoid04 = very close, including peripheral breakouts. but still bottom assembly issues.

speakercab2.FCStd = some changes to design:
  - celestion 10"
  - downfacing with no baffle (weight!)
