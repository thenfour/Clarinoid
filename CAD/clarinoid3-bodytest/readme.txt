fork of devboard-04, combined with body design sketches from \CAD\clarinoid3-devboardfork\00
for proto & testing of physical:
- physical clearance
- ergonomics
- strength of body

- castellated holes
- volume placement & sub-board
- panelization of sub-boards
- inter-board headers
- front & back assembly
- various cap touch slider patterns

00 = initial; actually made a lot of progress already. LH pretty much done.
01 = let's work on RH and try to get this thing produced.
     HM making a lot of progress, main subboard for example.
     but if i want ideal ergonomics / interconnect / component placement,
     then i am really running into space problems. i CAN fit everything,
     but placement is going to be compromised.
     i have this idea now to put the DAC and possible more on a sub-board,
     this will put it together as it's more critical for spacing / grounding,
     and it will ensure everything is close to the audio out jack. let's go to 02.
02 = trying adding more to pot subboard
